# JavaGame
## Game project developed during my course at NSCC

# Part 1
INSTRUCTIONS
For this project, you will create an arcade-style single player game that implements the following:
1. threading to control the movement of background items
2. a keylistener to control player interaction
3. a database connection to store the playerâ€™s name and score


# Part 2
INSTRUCTIONS
For this project, you are to modify the game you developed for Game Project #1 to accommodate multi-player interaction.
Your game must support client-server interaction through a network socket.
Player positions, player names, background item coordinates, and game scores must be sent to the server application and stored in a server-side database.
The game client application will update and retrieve these values and incorporate into the game play.
